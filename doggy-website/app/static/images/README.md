## Adding Boxty's Hero Photo

To display Boxty's photo on the homepage:

1. Save one of Boxty's photos as `boxty-hero.jpg` in this directory
2. Recommended size: 800x600 pixels or larger
3. The image will automatically appear in the hero section on the homepage

### Quick Command:

If you have Boxty's photo ready, you can copy it here:

```bash
# From the project root
cp /path/to/your/boxty-photo.jpg app/static/images/boxty-hero.jpg
```

### Supported formats:
- JPG/JPEG (recommended)
- PNG
- WEBP

The homepage will show a placeholder dog emoji if the image isn't found yet, so the app works either way!

## Other Images

You can add other static images here too:
- Logo variations
- Background patterns
- Icons
- Any other design assets

All files in this directory are served at: `/static/images/filename.ext`
